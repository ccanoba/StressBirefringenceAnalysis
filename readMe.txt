This folder structure contains the full source code (inside matlab) to use the polarized light ray tracing in stress birefringent media for a FEM analysis. The SBAnalysis (Stress Birefringence Analysis) folder contains the exemplary script which loads a converging lens and a square optical window examples. The Data folder contains the nodes solution used in the exemplary scripts. The Functions folder contains the main functions of "StressBirRayTracing" and the third party functions as well.

In the Analysis folder the script can be run directly as long as the current folder in MATLAB is the SBAnalysis folder. Any additional required paths are added inside the exemplary scripts.
