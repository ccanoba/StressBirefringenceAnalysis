This folder contains some examples for the calculation of the stress tensor for a lens under two conditions:
-Thermal gradient on a three-point mount
-Thermal gradient on a four-point mount

This examples works as entry for “StressBirRayTracing”. Other loads can be used; however, discretization should be mapped to ensure surfaces identification in the algorithm.
